app idea:
online real-time rock paper scissors

users will create an account and password to be able to use the app
will use SQL to store user data and game data
get and post calls to server api

users can see other user accounts and start/play games with them
turn based only - current idea is chess

live collaboration/interaction: socket.io

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
