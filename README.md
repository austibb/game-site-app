```

## Concept

- online real-time rock paper scissors

- users will create an account and password to be able to use the app
  will use SQL to store user data and game data
  get and post calls to server api

- users can see other user accounts and start/play games with them
  turn based only - current idea is chess

- live collaboration/interaction: socket.io

## Scenario

```md
WHEN I click login/enter
THEN I am prompted to enter credentials or create a new account
WHEN I enter the portal
THEN I can see a list of other active users and a list of users I am playing a game with
WHEN I click on a user's name
THEN I am presented with the option to initiate a game with them or view score history
WHEN I begin a game
THEN I am taken to a screen to play a game of rock paper scissors
WHEN I view score history
THEN I can see the game history between myself and the user
WHEN I click logout
THEN I am returned to the home page
```
